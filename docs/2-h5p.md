# Embedding H5P content in GitHub
{: .no_toc }

The H5P material produced by Griffith is hosted at griffith.h5p.com. Modules can be viewed on their domain or they can be embedded into other web pages. GitHub is a good option. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
<!-- You can style the preceding line using .fs for font size and .fw for font weight -->

To embed a H5P module into GitHub:

1. Create your GitHub repository. 
2. Optionally choose a template that allows for Markdown editing, like Evan Williams' Workshop-B or Just The Docs.
3. Turn on Pages in the repository settings (use the new actions option)
4. Log in to griffith.h5p.com and find the module you want to publish.
5. Click the ellipsis button and choose 'publish'
6. Select 'public'.
7. Click on 'Embed code'
8. Click on the embed code to copy it.
9. Return to your GitHub repository and paste the embed code into one of your pages.
10. Commit the change and wait for the publish Action to run.

Here's an example:

Again, note: You can see the material here, but it is hosted on H5P.com! If H5P.com were to be unavailable this content could not be seen!
